Migrating to BANanoVuetify from BANanoVueMaterial

1. NavBar
.SetHasBackButton - removed
.SetTitle - replace with .UpdateTitle as .SetTitle has been built in already
.Show - this is the default method, can be removed, only use .Hide when you dont want to hide navbar

2. Drawer

.SetTitle no longer exists
.UpdateTitle no longer exists
.SetPersistentFill no longer exists

- previously we had to create single events for each drawer item, now one event is returned where we get the id of the selected item.

The new event is draweritems_click(e as bananoevent)

Example:

vm.Drawer.AddItem("page1","done", "Page 1")
	vm.Drawer.AddItem("page2","done_all", "Page 2")

'*IMPORTANT
Sub draweritems_click(e As BANanoEvent)
	'get the id from the event
	Dim elID As String = vm.GetIDFromEvent(e)
	Select Case elID
	Case "page1"
		'update the title of the navigation bar
		vm.navbar.UpdateTitle("Navigation - Page 1")
		'show page 1
		vm.showpage(modPage1.name)
		'hide the navbar button
		vm.Hide("npage1")
		'show the navbar button
		vm.Show("npage2")
	Case "page2"
		'update the title of the navigation bar
		vm.navbar.UpdateTitle("Navigation - Page 2")
		'show page 2
		vm.showpage(modPage2.name)
		vm.Show("npage1")
		vm.Hide("npage2")
	End Select
End Sub

3. Container

the Grid object is incorporated into the container so you can remove .Grid calls
cont.Grid.SetBorder > cont.SetBorderRC

4. Dialog

.SetCloseOnEsc no longer exists
.SetClickOutsideToClose no longer exists
.SetBackdrop is included for backward compatibility use .SetHideOverlay for future
.SetFullScreen makes the dialog fullscreen in all devices (prev was only for small devices), use it in place of .SetMaximise

.AddControl has been extended to receive an extra parameter. This was necessary to remove the VMInputControl
VMInputControl class no longer exists
.SetScrollBar no longer exists for Dialogs
In NewDatePicker, bOpenOnFocus and bImmediately parameters have been removed.
VMText is now VMTextField
.Container.AddControlS - an extra parameter has been added just like .AddControl above.

5. Gijgo Table

The gijgo table is no longer used as we now have VMDataTable.
.CreateGijgoTable is now .CreateDataTable
When editing tables with _edit(e As BANanoEvent), this now should be _edit(item As Map)
When deleting on the tables with _delete(e As BANanoEvent), this now should be _delete(item As Map)
The .Refresh method for the DataTable is no longer applicable and has been removed
.Container.SetPosition becomes .Container.SetDevicePosition
.SetVisible(False) becomes .Hide
.SetVisible(True) becomes .Show - this is the default for all components
.Container.AddControlOnly becomes .Container.AddControl1

6. Toolbar
