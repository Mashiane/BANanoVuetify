BANanoVuetify started out as [BANanoVueMaterial](https://github.com/Mashiane/BANanoVueMaterial), a wrapper for the VueMaterial framework for one to write in B4X and get Javascript out using the BANano. [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) is a Material based framework for VueJS.

With BANano, one is able to code using VB like syntax using B4J from Anywhere Software and the result is a PWA (Progressive Web App) in SPA (Single Page Application) format.

- You code using B4J (Basic4Java i.e the B4X language)
- You code using BANano (B4J library)
- You get HTML, JS, CSS in return
